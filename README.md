# HCICollector

The HCI Ccollector is a container based metrics collection and graphing solution for NetApp HCI and SolidFire systems running Element OS 9+

# Current Release
v .6 (beta)

## Updates in .6
* Changed name of repository to hcicollector from sfcollector to more accurately reflect new functionality
* Changed file layout to be more consistent with container names and roles
* Retooled for Grafana 5.0.0
* Dashboards and datasources are now automatically added through the new provisioning functionality in Grafana 5
* Removed the external volume for the Grafana container, only Graphite uses an (optional) external iSCSI volume for persistent data
* Added the ability to poll for active alerts in the "SolidFire Cluster" dashboard.
* Added support for email alerting based on SolidFire events. Note: alerting queries do not support templating variables so if you have multiple clusters you will need to use "*" for the cluster instance instead of the "$Cluster" variable. The net effect of this is that the alert pane will show alerts from ALL clusters instead of an individually selected cluster.
* New detailed install document
* Added a very basic installation script

See the changelog for updates in previous versions

# Description
The SFCollector is a fully packaged metrics collection and graphing solution for Element OS 9+ based on these containers: 
* sfcollector -> runs a python script to scrape results from SolidFire clusters 
* vmwcollector -> vSphere stats collector, written in Go
* graphite -> keeps all time series data from the HCICollector
* grafana -> Graphing engine

The collector stores metrics in graphite and presents those metrics through a set of pre-configured Grafana dashboards.  Optionally, the Netapp [Trident](https://netapp.io/2018/01/26/one-container-integration/) project can be used for persistent storage of metrics on a NetApp system.

## Prerequisites
* Docker host running 17.03+ 
* Account information for vCenter (optional) and SolidFire components to collect against 
 
## Quick and Dirty Installation and Configuration

```
# install Docker CE, docker-compose and iSCSI client packages
# enable and start docker, dnsmasq and open-iscsi service
# clone the hcicollector repository
git clone https://github.com/jedimt/hcicollector
# execute the install_hcicollector.sh script and provide the requested input 
cd hcicollector; sudo ./install_hcicollector.sh
# w/o Trident storage, create local volume using the volume name chosen in install wizard
#   docker volume create --name=chosen-name
# start up the containers
sudo docker-compose up
# to run in detached mode: sudo docker-compose up -d
```
