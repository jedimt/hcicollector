# HCICollector

The HCI Collector is a container-based metrics collection and graphing solution for NetApp HCI and SolidFire systems running Element OS v11 or better.

# Current Release

v0.7 (beta)

## Updates in 0.7

* TODO

See the changelog for updates in previous versions

# Description

The SFCollector is a fully packaged metrics collection and graphing solution for Element OS 9+ based on these containers: 
* sfcollector -> runs a python script to scrape results from SolidFire clusters 
* vmwcollector -> vSphere stats collector, written in Go
* graphite -> keeps all time series data from the HCICollector
* grafana -> graphing engine

The collector stores metrics in graphite and presents those metrics through a set of pre-configured Grafana dashboards.  Optionally, the Netapp [Trident](https://netapp.io/2018/01/26/one-container-integration/) project may be used for persistent storage of metrics on a NetApp system.

## Prerequisites

* Docker host running 19.10 
* Account information for vCenter (optional) and Element cluster components to collect against 
 
## Quick and Dirty Installation and Configuration

```
# install Docker CE, docker-compose and iSCSI client packages
# enable and start docker, dnsmasq and open-iscsi service
# clone the hcicollector repository
git clone https://github.com/jedimt/hcicollector
# execute the install_hcicollector.sh script and provide the requested input 
cd hcicollector; sudo ./install_hcicollector.sh
# w/o Trident storage, create local volume using the volume name chosen in install wizard
#   docker volume create --name=chosen-name
# start up the containers
sudo docker-compose up
# to run in detached mode: sudo docker-compose up -d
```

### Stand-Alone Use of Collector Script

Should you want to use collect Element cluster metrics in your own project or existing Graphite
environment, you may use solidfire_graphite_collector.py script from this repo (`python3 solidfire_graphite_collector.py -h`).
